# README
[live demo](https://my365px.herokuapp.com/#/)

365px is a photography platform where ammature or professional photogrpahers can share, like and follow photos, and other users/photogreapgers. This application was inspired by the original 500px. 365px uses Ruby on Rails/Postgresql for the backend composition and React/Redux for the frontend, alongside mamy dependencies.


# Features
- Users can sign up for an account and securely provide their personal inforamtion. User authentication protected with BCrypt.
- Users are able to upload photos from their personal machine for which images are fed to the profile page as photos index.

# Technologies used

- Ruby/Ruby on Rails was used as the backend framework for this full-stack web application for its convention to create API endpoints to interact with the frontend and built-in support of REST-ful architecture and relational database. 

- System dependencies includes: babel, lodash, react/redux, redux logger/thunk and webpack.

- Database creation: PostgreSQL was used for the backend relational database management. It was chosen for its rubust and optimized technology allowing for relational data and protection against data corruption. 

- React / Redux : Redux was used to keep track of user and upload data information using a persistant Redux store throughout the application, allowing to pass in data to multiple React components and therefore udpate the front-end display of the application.
